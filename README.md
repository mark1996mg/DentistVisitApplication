Java test excercise for CGI

Description of my task

0) Stage 0
  Was very straightfoward and didn't take long at all. Initially application didn't run once I imported project to 
  IntelliJ but I managed to fix it quickly by making necessary  changed in pom file
  
1) Stage 1
  Wasn't difficult but I had no knowledge on Thymeleaf so read about topic and looked into application to understand it.
  Took only few hours, because of studying.
  
2) Stage 2
  This was very straightfoward and easy, didn't have any difficulties
  
3) Stage 3
  This was the most difficult part and took majority of time, specificly implementing edit. 
  Didn't have have much difficulties with backend Java solution, only problem where I got little bit stuck was that input data and loaded data from DB was getting 
  lost once I posted something and received error message (input check). 
  So I found a solution that fixed it from stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15903238/passing-bindingresult-through-redirectionattributes
  I had mostly difficulties with frontend since I mainly have experience with backend and it's been a while since I did something in frontend with html, css, ... etc.
  What took a lot of time was the way I wanted to implement editing since I had some ideas but since I had bit trouble with them and it took too much time i decided to
  implement easiest solution which was to open data to be edited in a different page as a form.
  
5) Stage 4
  Took a little time to implement search but I got the solution idea from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_table.asp
